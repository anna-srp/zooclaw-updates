feat(ios): redesign AgentsView, add agent update flow (#1469)

## Summary

Redesigns AgentsView (the agent catalog) to match the Zoo Square v2
EXPLORE design and adds a new agent-update affordance plus a global
"agent hired" toast that survives tab switches.

### Key changes
- **EXPLORE-style row layout**: gradient background, HankenGrotesk
typography, dark navy active pill, dynamic category tabs driven by the
catalog response
- **Liquid glass menu button** (iOS 26) — fixed a latent `#if
swift(>=6.2)` gate that was preprocessing the effect out under
`SWIFT_VERSION=5.0`
- **API-driven categories**: removed the hardcoded `AgentCategory` enum;
`selectedCategory: String?` filters live against catalog `category`
values, deduped case-insensitively
- **Reusable `Toast` component** (`Views/Components/Toast.swift`) with
optional avatar/icon/emoji + action button, plus a
`.toast(item:autoDismissAfter:)` view modifier
- **Agent update flow**: when `UserAgent.has_update == true`, row shows
`plus.arrow.trianglehead.clock` + a "NEW" pill; tap calls `POST
/openclaw/agents/{id}/redeploy` (synchronous), refreshes user agents
- **Hired toast is now global** — lives on `AppShellView` (Layer 4 in
the shell ZStack) so it persists across tab switches; "Say hi" navigates
to chat
- **Hired-action simplification**: ellipsis sheet (Chat Now / Fire /
Cancel) replaced with a direct `ellipsis.message`-tap that opens chat
- **Centralized colors**: promoted `deepNavy` (#0B0F1A), `accentRed`
(#E63946), `coolTextSecondary` (#5A6478), `coolBorderLight` (#E8EBF0) to
top-level AppTheme; collapsed 5+ duplicate hex literals across
PaywallView, VoiceWaveformView, RedeemGiftCodeView, ComposeInputPanel
- **Model alignment with backend**: removed `AgentCatalogItem.isNew`
(backend never produced `is_new`); removed `UserAgent.isDefault`
(backend never produced it either; SidebarDrawerView now distinguishes
the main agent by `id == "main"`)

### Backend touchpoints (already shipped)
- `POST /openclaw/agents/{agent_id}/redeploy` — used by the new update
flow
- `GET /openclaw/agents` — `has_update` field per agent (computed in
`services/openclaw/agent_response.py`)

## Test plan
- [ ] Open AgentsView — verify EXPLORE layout, gradient background,
category tabs populated from catalog
- [ ] Liquid glass menu button visible at top-left and refracts content
beneath
- [ ] Tap `+` on an unhired agent — verify hire completes, "Hired!"
toast slides in from the top with avatar + "Say hi"
- [ ] Switch to chat tab while toast is on screen — toast persists
- [ ] Tap "Say hi" — navigates to chat with that agent
- [ ] Wait 5s without action — toast auto-dismisses
- [ ] Hire a second agent rapidly — second toast replaces the first with
a fresh 5s timer
- [ ] For an agent with `has_update == true` — NEW pill on title and
update icon on the right; tap shows spinner during redeploy and clears
`has_update` after refresh
- [ ] For a hired agent — tap `ellipsis.message` icon — opens chat
directly (no sheet)
- [ ] Filter by category — verify only matching agents show; tap "All"
pill returns full catalog
- [ ] `xcodebuild test -only-testing:ZooClawTests/AgentServiceTests
-only-testing:ZooClawTests/AgentViewModelTests` passes
- [ ] `swiftlint --strict` — 0 violations

## Notes
- 11 commits, each independently buildable. Linear history, fully
rebased on latest `main`.
- Backend has no per-agent `update` endpoint; we use the existing
`redeploy` which atomically pulls the latest catalog version.
Synchronous on the server, so iOS doesn't need polling.
- The new `Toast` component is generic — `RedeemSuccessToast` /
`ModelDegradationToast` could migrate to it in a follow-up if desired.

test(web): migrate inline queryBy*().toBeNull() to jest-dom (#1046) (#1478)

## Summary
Follow-up to #1029 jest-dom adoption. Two parts:

1. **Migrate 78 inline RTL presence assertions across 15 files**
- 46 sites in 11 `tests/unit/app/` files (the `app/` batch noted in
#1046)
- 32 sites in 4 `tests/unit/components/` files that #1029's
`.toBeDefined()` migration script didn't touch (it migrated the positive
form but not `.toBeNull()` / `.not.toBeNull()` on `queryBy*`)
   - Transforms (mirror of #1029):
- `expect((screen.)?queryBy*(...)).toBeNull()` →
`.not.toBeInTheDocument()`
- `expect((screen.)?queryBy*(...)).not.toBeNull()` →
`.toBeInTheDocument()`
- `expect(screen.getByText(...)).not.toBeNull()` →
`.toBeInTheDocument()` (one site in `agents-manager-publish`)
- Variable-reference forms (~91 sites in `app/`, getAttribute on local
consts) remain out of scope — they need per-site type tracing.

2. **Add symmetric `no-restricted-syntax` lint guards for
`tests/unit/**`** mirroring #1029's `.toBeDefined()` rule:
   - bans `expect(queryBy*(...)).toBeNull()`
   - bans `expect(queryBy*(...)).not.toBeNull()`
The rule's existing-violation list was the 32 sites in `components/`
cleaned up in part 1.

## Out of scope
- `tests/unit/hooks/` — survey found 0 zero-ambiguity inline candidates
(the issue's "biggest payoff" call was based on `render`/import counts,
not on actual assertion patterns; hook tests assert on
`result.current.*`, not DOM nodes). No PR worth doing.
- Variable-reference forms (e.g. `const el = getByTestId(...);
expect(el).not.toBeNull()`) — per-site type tracing, separate PR.
- Hygiene items still on #1046: `pnpm.overrides` location,
`@xyflow/system` transitive vitest@1.6.1 dedup.

## Test plan
- [x] `pnpm lint` green (cache clean — both new lint selectors pass
after part 1)
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` green
- [x] `pnpm test:unit` on all 15 affected files → 364 passed / 1 todo, 0
new failures
- [ ] CI `code-quality / lint-and-test` green

fix(web): sanitize video URL in <video> attribute (#1328) (#1462)

## Summary

`lib/api/chat.ts` 的 `sendVideoGeneration` 之前把 `videoItem.url` 原样塞进
template literal 的 \`<video controls src=\"\${url}\">\`。如果 URL 出现
\`\"\`,attribute 边界被打破,后面的内容会被 HTML 解析成相邻属性(如 \`onload=\"alert(1)\"\`)——
而这串内容是会被存进 chat session 然后回放成 HTML 的。\`b64_json\` 分支由 data-URL 前缀和
base64 字符集约束,实际暴露面是 URL 分支。

抽 \`buildVideoResponseContentHtml(src)\`,改用
\`document.createElement('video')\` + \`outerHTML\` —— 让浏览器 HTML
serializer 按 WHATWG 规范处理 attribute escaping(\`&\` → \`&amp;\`, \`\"\` →
\`&quot;\`)。一个含 \`\"\` 的 URL 在序列化→重解析后会**圆环回到原值**,不会冒出新属性。

## Test

新建 \`tests/unit/lib/api/chat.unit.spec.ts\`,3 个用例:

- 安全 URL 输出 baseline 形式(controls + src + style)
- \`data:video/mp4;base64,...\` 原样保留
- **回归断言**(#1328):一组带 \`\"\` / \`&\` / \`<\` / 拼接 \`onerror=...\` 的
tricky URL,断言 \`getAttribute('src')\` 与原 URL 完全相等,且 attribute 名集合恒为
\`['controls', 'src', 'style']\`(无注入)

本地反向验证:把 helper 临时改回 template-literal 形式,回归用例报 \`expected
'https://x.com/a' to be 'https://x.com/a\"b.mp4'\` —— 测试确实拦得住
regression。

## Closes

Closes #1328

## Test plan

- [x] \`pnpm test:unit tests/unit/lib/api/chat.unit.spec.ts\` (3/3)
- [x] \`pnpm test:unit tests/unit/hooks/useLiteLLMApi.unit.spec.ts\` (现有
caller 不受影响)
- [x] \`npx tsc --noEmit\` clean
- [x] \`npx eslint\` / \`npx prettier --check\` clean
- [ ] CI: code-quality / lint-and-test

chore: remove unused STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (#1474)

## Summary
- Remove `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from backend settings, `.env.example`,
and setup docs
- This env var was defined but never referenced in any code path
(frontend or backend)
- Publishable keys (`pk_`) are public by design and don't need
server-side config
- Part of a key-leak audit; `pydantic-settings` `extra="ignore"` means
no env cleanup needed

## Test plan
- [ ] CI passes (no code references this field)
- [ ] Backend starts without `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in env (already
the case — field had empty default)

feat(ios): Post-auth onboarding view redesigns (PR-B of 2) (#1467)

## Summary

**PR-B of 2** in the onboarding redesign split. Companion to #1458
(PR-A, **merged**). Ships the Figma redesigns of the four post-auth
views.

After this PR lands, the visual onboarding refresh is feature-complete:
hero → name → role → useCase → register → OTP → agentSelect →
notifications → setupLoading all use the new design.

### EmailOTPLoginView
- 6-box OTP grid with invisible `TextField` driving iOS one-time-code
autofill from SMS / Mail.
- Resend button reads the email back from `authViewModel.emailOTPState`
(fix for the bug PR-A's review caught — previously sent an empty
string).
- `HankenGrotesk-Bold` title, `Inter-Regular` subtitle/countdown.

### AgentSelectView
- Replaces the carousel with a category-tab + scrollable list.
- Multi-select; honors `OnboardingViewModel.maxSelectedAgents = 3` cap
(enforced in-view).
- Surfaces `agentViewModel.catalogError` as a "Couldn't load agents /
Retry" UI when the catalog fetch fails — no infinite spinner on network
blips.
- "Not right now" secondary action sets `selectedAgentIds = []` and
advances to notifications.

### SetupLoadingView
- Consumes `AgentViewModel.installAgent`'s `Bool` return; failed
installs are accumulated into `installFailures` and surfaced via
`errorContent` with a Retry. Removes the silent-failure path where users
were sent to the chat with broken agents.
- Cancels the install `Task` on disappear to prevent zombie polls.

### OnboardingFlowView
- Refactored to the gradient-background + arrow-back-button design.
- Routes the redesigned post-auth views with their updated init
signatures (`EmailOTPLoginView` now takes `viewModel:` alongside
`onAuthenticated:`).

## Test plan

- [ ] Onboarding end-to-end: hero → name → role → useCase → register →
OTP → agentSelect → notifications → setupLoading
- [ ] OTP autofill from SMS / Mail when verification code arrives
- [ ] Resend OTP uses the previously-entered email (not blank)
- [ ] AgentSelect catalog error path: kill network mid-load → "Couldn't
load agents / Retry" appears; retry succeeds when network returns
- [ ] AgentSelect multi-select: cap at 3
- [ ] SetupLoading install failure path: simulate a failed install →
"Couldn't install: <name>" with Retry button; Retry re-runs only failed
installs

## Notes

- Size: **873 / 2000 lines** — comfortable budget.
- Depends on #1458 (merged).
- Closes the onboarding redesign initiative — no further view PRs
anticipated.

chore: remove unused R2 private bucket config and code (#1472)

## Summary
- Remove unused `enterprise-user-data` private bucket config — no code

fix: defense-in-depth auth & clickjacking headers (exclude mini-chat embed) (#1436)

## Summary
- **admin_cron**: add `require_internal_service_key` dependency to all 6
cron trigger/query endpoints (defense-in-depth behind CF Zero Trust)
- **orders/admin/grant**: add `require_admin_user` dependency
- **next.config**: add `X-Frame-Options: DENY` +
`Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none'` (clickjacking
protection)
- **billing_gateway**: retry `topup_wallet` once on 5xx with 1s backoff
(Lago transient error resilience)

## Context
Production incident 2026-04-27: Lago returned a transient 500 on `POST
/api/v1/wallet_transactions` during a user's subscription grant. The
user saw "Failed to confirm order" and had to re-purchase on a lower
plan. The topup retry prevents this class of failure from reaching the
user.

Security hardening prompted by external vulnerability reports — CF Zero
Trust already protects `/admin/*`, but application-layer auth adds
defense-in-depth. `X-Frame-Options` addresses a reported clickjacking
concern.

## Test plan
- [ ] `pytest tests/unit/test_stripe_billing_gateway.py` — 15 tests pass
(2 new: 500 retry success + 500 retry then raise)
- [ ] `pyright` clean on all changed files
- [ ] Verify cron scheduler passes `X-Internal-Service-Key` header
(otherwise cron triggers will 401)
- [ ] Verify `/admin/grant` still works from admin UI (JWT auth)
- [ ] Verify `zooclaw.ai` pages return `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header
after deploy

feat(claw-interface): add R2 presigned URL endpoint for frontend (#1465)

## Summary
- Add `GET /api/storage/r2/presign` endpoint for frontend to obtain
presigned upload URLs
- Uses existing `R2StorageClient.generate_presigned_put_url` — no extra
network hop to ecap-proxy-service
- JWT auth via `Depends(get_current_user)` at router level
- Companion to SerendipityOneInc/ecap-proxy-service#39 (same feature on
proxy side)

## API

```
GET /api/storage/r2/presign?filename=photo.png&file_type=image&content_type=image/png
Authorization: Bearer <jwt>

Response:
{
  "presigned_url": "https://r2.../presigned?sig=...",
  "public_url": "https://cdn.example.com/image/20260429/abc.png"
}
```

## Files Changed
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `services/claw-interface/app/routes/storage.py` | New route with
`PresignedUrlResponse` schema |
| `services/claw-interface/app/create_app.py` | Register
`storage.router` |
| `services/claw-interface/tests/unit/test_storage.py` | 9 unit tests |

## Test plan
- [x] All pre-commit hooks pass (ruff, pyright, import-linter)
- [ ] CI unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual test via telepresence after deploy

chore: remove unused LITELLM_AUTH_TOKEN from .env.example (#1466)

## Summary
- Remove `LITELLM_AUTH_TOKEN` from `.env.example` — it is not consumed
by any code (`settings.py` has no such field, no business logic
references it)
- The corresponding LiteLLM key (`sk-MRwyZJ8ZT7pAIOoESdRwsg`) has been
confirmed invalid (401 `token_not_found_in_db`)
- K8s deployments (`claw-interface`, `ecommerce-studio-service`) still
inject this env var but it is dead config — will be cleaned up
separately in infra

## Test plan
- [ ] CI passes (no code change, only `.env.example`)

- require internal service key requests to include a valid Bearer user
token
- allow internal mutation endpoints only when the authenticated user
email ends with `@srp.one`
- reject the legacy flow that passed only the service key in the
`Authorization` header

## Context
- internal mutation access should be bound to an authenticated internal
account, not only a shared service key

feat(ios): Pre-auth onboarding redesign with role + use-case screens (#1458)

## Summary

**PR-A of 2** in the onboarding redesign split. Builds on the
infrastructure landed in #1452 and ships the redesigned **pre-auth**
flow: hero → name → role → use case → register.

This PR was extracted from #1450 to fit the 2000-line PR size budget.
PR-B (forthcoming) will ship the post-auth view redesigns:
EmailOTPLoginView, AgentSelectView, SetupLoadingView, and the full
OnboardingFlowView refactor.

### Pre-auth view redesigns

- **HeroView** — video background loop, Montserrat + Instrument Serif
tagline.
- **NameInputView** — editorial italic-serif underline input, panda
avatar, Continue pinned bottom.
- **RoleSelectionView** *(new)* — six-card grid; default-first with VM
rehydration on back-nav.
- **UseCaseSelectionView** *(new)* — four-card grid; same rehydration
pattern.
- **RegisterView** — simplified email-only entry with Google / Apple
SSO, inline terms/privacy.

### VM scaffolding

- New `roleSelection` / `useCaseSelection` enum cases.
- `selectedRole` / `selectedUseCase` storage (drives the rehydration on
back-nav).
- `selectedAgentIds: Set<String>` with `maxSelectedAgents = 3`.
- `goBack` table aligned with `canGoBack` (no dead branches).

### NotificationsView fix

PR #1452 deleted three onboarding notification imagesets but main's
NotificationsView still references them. This PR ships the redesigned
view (logo_black + animated cards) to restore main's visual integrity
rather than leaving it broken until PR-B.

### Compatibility shims

`AgentSelectView` and `SetupLoadingView` keep their main-version designs
but are minimally updated to consume `selectedAgentIds: Set<String>`
(replacing the dropped `selectedAgentId: String?`). Their full redesigns
ship in PR-B.

## Tests

- 28/28 OnboardingViewModelTests pass.
- New coverage: rehydration, set mutations, `maxSelectedAgents`, new
screen navigation.

## Test plan

- [ ] Onboarding pre-auth flow end-to-end: hero → name → role → use case
→ register
- [ ] Back-navigation from role/use-case restores prior selection
(rehydration)
- [ ] Notifications screen renders correctly (logo + animated cards, no
missing images)
- [ ] Agent select still works end-to-end (compat shim consuming
`selectedAgentIds.first`)
- [ ] Existing chat / agents / settings flows unchanged

## Notes

- Size: **1133 / 2000 lines** — comfortable budget, no `size-override`
needed.
- Mid-flow visual mismatch is expected on TestFlight builds between this
PR and PR-B (new pre-auth + old EmailOTP / AgentSelect / SetupLoading).
- Supersedes the corresponding portions of #1450; #1450 will be closed
or rebased once both halves land.

fix(web): AgentDetailClient Escape key listener race (#1275) (#1461)

## Summary

`AgentDetailClient` 的 Escape 处理是 `useCallback(handler, [showConfirm,
showSuccess, ...])` + `useEffect(addEventListener, [handleKeyDown])` ——
每次 modal state 翻转都会回收旧 listener、附新 listener。问题是 `confirm → await
hireAgent → setShowSuccess(true)` 这条 async 路径里,success modal 进
DOM(commit)和 listener 重新挂载是两步。中间窗口里 Escape 落到旧 closure(`showSuccess:
false`),什么都不关。

改成 ref pattern:listener 挂载一次(empty deps),每次 render 把最新 state 写到
ref;handler 调用时读 ref。优先级 / 触发链都不变。

## Repro / 验证

- 之前:`Escape key closes modals (priority order) > success open → Escape
closes success` 在 16 轮 full-suite 跑里偶发 fail ~12%
- 修复后本地 16 轮单文件全过(`pnpm test:unit AgentDetailClient.unit.spec.tsx`)

## 关闭

Closes #1275

## Test plan

- [x] `pnpm test:unit
tests/unit/app/agents-manager/AgentDetailClient.unit.spec.tsx` × 16
轮全过(31 tests)
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` 全仓 clean
- [x] `npx eslint
src/app/[locale]/agents-manager/[id]/AgentDetailClient.tsx` clean
- [x] `npx prettier --check` clean
- [ ] CI: code-quality / lint-and-test

chore(web): migrate 11 files from inline style to Tailwind (#754) (#1457)

## Summary

- 迁 11 个 grandfathered 文件 / 21 处 inline `style` → Tailwind utility
- `eslint.config.mjs` `react/forbid-dom-props` ignores: **45 →
34**(shrink-only sentinel 通过)
- 推进 #754 长 tracker;选品依据:**当前 ignores 中非 branded、纯静态可 TW 化的候选**

## Files

**Batch 1 — 5 files / 12 处**
- `PublicFooter.tsx` (5): h-8/w-auto, mt-2, h-5/w-5 ×2, justify-start
- `PublicHeader.tsx` (2): inline-flex/items-center/gap-1.5,
block/text-center
- `PlanCard.tsx` (3): w-[0.6em]/h-[1.15em]/align-bottom, leading-none
×2, layered absolute layout
- `InputArea.tsx` (1): hidden
- `FeedbackDialog.tsx` (1): max-h-[min(500px,70vh)]

**Batch 2 — 6 files / 9 处**
- `ThinkingIndicator.tsx` (3): [animation-delay:0s/0.2s/0.4s]
- `ArchivedSessionPanel.tsx` (1): min-h-[500px]
- `AssetsPanel.tsx` (1): aspect-[3/4]
- `UserMenu.tsx` (1): border-border(去掉冗余 var 引用)
- `DowngradeConfirmModal.tsx` (1):
bg-[var(--ecap-billing-badge-current)]
- `MarkdownContent.tsx` (1): [overflow-wrap:anywhere],并删去冗余的
wordBreak(已被 className `break-words` 覆盖)

## Notes

- Issue 原列的 top-5(LoginForm / verify / GeneralTab / PaywallContent /
ChannelStep)早已被前序 opportunistic PR 清理完毕,已不在 ignores 列表里。
- 当前 ignores 中量最大的几个文件(`CompanionSelectStep` 11 处、`InviteCodeStep` 9
处、`OnboardingLayout` 7 处等)都是 **branded 模块** 内的 `rgba(...)` / `#hex` 颜色,被
#796 theme refactor 阻塞,本 PR 跳过。
- **Audit gotcha**:ESLint `react/forbid-dom-props` 同时拦截 `style={var}`(单
brace)和 `style={{...}}`(双 brace)。第一轮 grep `'style={{'` 漏掉了
`MMAttachments.tsx` 里 3 处 `style={boxStyle}` 的 LEGIT 数据驱动样式(image 尺寸
from runtime metadata)。MMAttachments 保留在 ignores 内,留待后续 PR 加
inline-disable + 原因注释。
- 所有迁移都是 1:1 映射(rem 基于 root 16px);`break-words` Tailwind 即 `word-break:
break-word`,所以原 inline 的 `wordBreak: 'break-word'` 是冗余,删去。

## Test plan

- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` clean
- [x] `npx eslint <files>` clean
- [x] `bash scripts/check-ignores-shrink-only.sh` pass(45 → 34)
- [x] `npx vitest run` 12 spec / 279 tests pass
- [ ] Visual sanity:landing footer/header,billing PlanCard 价格滚动 +
DowngradeConfirmModal,FeedbackDialog 弹窗,UserMenu
虚线分隔,ArchivedSessionPanel 列表高度,AssetsPanel 卡片纵横比,MarkdownContent 长 URL
换行,ThinkingIndicator 三点交错动画

refactor(web): RQ v2 PR-a — useUserAgents 切 useQuery (facade 不变) (#1349)

## 背景

按
[`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-react-query-migration-v2.md`](../blob/main/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-25-react-query-migration-v2.md)
落地 **PR-a**(spec 拆分中的第一个,无依赖,后续 PR-b/c/d/e/f 均建在其上)。

v2 spec 要清扫的是 v1 没覆盖的"包了 `lib/api/*` wrapper 但仍 `useEffect + setState`"的
~34 个文件——它们已经避开了 v1 的 raw `fetch()` lint guard,但 RQ 的 dedup / cache /
focus refetch / 自动重试一项没拿到。本 PR 是这条尾巴的第一刀。

## 改动范围

| 文件 | 操作 | 说明 |
|---|---|---|
| `src/hooks/queries/openclaw/keys.ts` | 新建 | openclaw domain query-key
工厂,uid 进 key(D4: 跨账号缓存隔离) |
| `src/hooks/useUserAgents.ts` | 重写 hook 内部 | `useState + 3×useEffect` →
`useQuery`;模块级 `refreshUserAgentsCache` 整体保留 |
| `tests/unit/hooks/useUserAgents.unit.spec.ts` | 加 createQueryWrapper +
getUserInfo mock | 既有 19 个 case 全过 |

**Public API 完全不变**:`{ agents, isLoading, refreshAgents }` + 模块函数
`refreshUserAgentsCache({ force? })`。9 个 `useUserAgents` callsite + 5 个
`refreshUserAgentsCache` callsite 不动一行。

## 关键决策

### D2 facade 保留 — 内部切到 useQuery
照 v1 PR-7 (`useLiteLLMApi`) 的做法,从消费方看 hook 形状不变,只是内部 fetch 路径换成 RQ。这样 PR
范围 = 2 个文件改动,不是 14 个 callsite 联动。

### 模块级 `refreshUserAgentsCache` 暂不迁
该函数的 `_inflight` / `_lastResult` / `THROTTLE_MS` 对 5 个 imperative
caller(post-mutation 强刷)是契约,把它切成 `queryClient.fetchQuery` 需要先建
`getQueryClient()` 单例,工作量超出本 PR。短期"双轨"通过 `setQueryData(localStorage 值)`
listener 保持一致,后续 PR 再清理。

### `isLoading = query.isPending`(不用 `isFetching`)
旧 hook 的 `isLoading` 只在"无缓存且首次拉"时为 true,跟
`isPending`(还没拿到任何数据)语义匹配。`isFetching` 会在 background refetch / focus
refetch 时也 true,会让 SideNav 等 caller 闪 spinner。

### `initialData + initialDataUpdatedAt: 0`
从 localStorage 缓存读 `initialData` 保留"刷新页面有缓存先显示"的 UX;`updatedAt: 0` 让 RQ
仍把数据视为 stale,mount 时还是会触发网络刷新——两者结合 = 旧版"先缓存,再后台刷新"行为不变。

### Listener 用 `setQueryData` 而非 `invalidateQueries`
`refreshUserAgentsCache` 派发 `'ecap:agents:updated'` 之前已经写好了
localStorage,网络已经 settled。这种情况下 invalidate→refetch 是浪费,直接
`setQueryData(localStorage 值)` 把 RQ cache 跟模块缓存对齐最便宜。跨 tab 的 `storage`
事件同源同处理。

## 验证

- `pnpm tsc --noEmit`:无错
- `pnpm lint`:无报
- `pnpm test:unit tests/unit/hooks/useUserAgents.unit.spec.ts`:19/19
passed
- `pnpm test:unit`(全仓):4183/4183 passed,0 回归

## 不在范围内

- 模块级 `refreshUserAgentsCache` 切 RQ(后续 cleanup PR)
- PR-b: `useClawSettings` / `useBillingCredits` /
`useOfficialAgentCatalog` / `useCustomAgentPublishes`
- PR-c: `claw-settings/` 10 个组件
- PR-d: `chat/` 资源面板 / onboarding / skills 浏览
- PR-e: billing 表面(高风险,串行)
- PR-f: 长尾散点 + 复跑调研命令

## Test plan

- [ ] CI `code-quality / lint-and-test` 绿
- [ ] 手测 `/chat`:agent 列表加载,切 agent 正常
- [ ] SideNav agent 列表显示
- [ ] Skill 详情页 → "添加到我的 agents" → 列表自动刷新(验证 `'ecap:agents:updated'`
事件路径)
- [ ] 退出登录 → 重登(验证 uid 切换 key 重拉)

feat(ios): Onboarding infrastructure and asset cleanup (#1452)

## Summary

Foundation for the upcoming onboarding redesign — ships independently of
any view changes so the follow-up view PR can reuse it without refactor
churn. This is **PR 1 of 2**, split out so each PR fits the 2000-line
budget.

### Theme & fonts
- `AppTheme.Onboarding` palette of named tokens (text / border / badge /
avatar colors).
- `AppTheme.chatBackgroundView()` helper backed by the new
`onboarding_bg` imageset.
- Hanken Grotesk Bold + Medium TTFs registered via `Info.plist`
`UIAppFonts`.

### Services
- `AgentService.installAgent` + `agentOperation` — async install with
operation-id polling; replaces the synchronous hire path for installs
that may take >5s server-side.
- `AgentViewModel.installAgent` wraps the new API with a 60-poll cap
(5min budget) and Sentry timeout capture.
- `AgentViewModel.catalogError` surfaces fetch failures (staging for the
upcoming retry UI).

### VideoLoopView lifecycle
- `dismantleUIView` pauses the player, drains the queue, releases the
looper when SwiftUI removes the view.
- `accessibilityElementsHidden` on the wrapped UIView so VoiceOver
doesn't announce the decorative loop.

### Asset cleanup
- Remove `loading.gif` (4.4 MB unused since #208).
- Remove three unused `onboarding_*_notification` imagesets superseded
by the new design.
- Add `welcome.m4v` (3.5 MB, ffmpeg re-encoded from the larger mp4) —
consumed by `HeroView` in PR 2.
- Add new imagesets that role / use-case / register screens consume in
PR 2: `onboarding_bg`, six `job_*`, four `use_*`. **Orphaned in this
PR**; consumers land in PR 2.

### Other
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with notes on auto-bundling, font registration,
and asset-grep patterns.
- `AccountService.swift` minor 1-line phone OTP cleanup.

## Why no view changes here?

The Figma onboarding redesign would push the diff to ~2300 lines, over
the 2000 budget. Splitting along the infrastructure / view boundary lets
each PR review independently:
- Reviewers of this PR focus on services, palette, and asset hygiene
with no UI surface area.
- Reviewers of PR 2 focus on the Figma flow with all primitives already
in place.

## Test plan

- [ ] App builds and launches cleanly on iPhone 17 Pro simulator
- [ ] Existing onboarding still works (no behavior change for users —
old views consume nothing from the new infra yet)
- [ ] `swiftlint` zero violations
- [ ] No TestFlight regressions vs the previous build

```

### PR Body
## Summary

Foundation for the upcoming onboarding redesign — ships independently of any view changes so the follow-up view PR can reuse it without refactor churn. This is **PR 1 of 2**, split out so each PR fits the 2000-line budget.

### Theme & fonts
- `AppTheme.Onboarding` palette of named tokens (text / border / badge / avatar colors).
- `AppTheme.chatBackgroundView()` helper backed by the new `onboarding_bg` imageset.
- Hanken Grotesk Bold + Medium TTFs registered via `Info.plist` `UIAppFonts`.

### Services
- `AgentService.installAgent` + `agentOperation` — async install with operation-id polling; replaces the synchronous hire path for installs that may take >5s server-side.
- `AgentViewModel.installAgent` wraps the new API with a 60-poll cap (5min budget) and Sentry timeout capture.
- `AgentViewModel.catalogError` surfaces fetch failures (staging for the upcoming retry UI).

### VideoLoopView lifecycle
- `dismantleUIView` pauses the player, drains the queue, releases the looper when SwiftUI removes the view.
- `accessibilityElementsHidden` on the wrapped UIView so VoiceOver doesn't announce the decorative loop.

### Asset cleanup
- Remove `loading.gif` (4.4 MB unused since #208).
- Remove three unused `onboarding_*_notification` imagesets superseded by the new design.
- Add `welcome.m4v` (3.5 MB, ffmpeg re-encoded from the larger mp4) — consumed by `HeroView` in PR 2.
- Add new imagesets that role / use-case / register screens consume in PR 2: `onboarding_bg`, six `job_*`, four `use_*`. **Orphaned in this PR**; consumers land in PR 2.

### Other
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with notes on auto-bundling, font registration, and asset-grep patterns.
- `AccountService.swift` minor 1-line phone OTP cleanup.

## Why no view changes here?

The Figma onboarding redesign would push the diff to ~2300 lines, over the 2000 budget. Splitting along the infrastructure / view boundary lets each PR review independently:
- Reviewers of this PR focus on services, palette, and asset hygiene with no UI surface area.
- Reviewers of PR 2 focus on the Figma flow with all primitives already in place.

## Test plan

- [ ] App builds and launches cleanly on iPhone 17 Pro simulator
- [ ] Existing onboarding still works (no behavior change for users — old views consume nothing from the new infra yet)
- [ ] `swiftlint` zero violations
- [ ] No TestFlight regressions vs the previous build

refactor(web): final cleanup — render-phase reset + drop redundant memos (#1454)

## Summary
\`feature/use-less-effect\` 系列收尾 PR。PR 1-3 之后真实的反模式总数比初步审计预估的小得多 — 计划里
PR 4(链式 setState)和 PR 5(边角)的多数候选深读后都是 J4 (justified effect):prop-driven
mount lifecycle / debounced corrective watchdog / unmount-only timer
cleanup / SSR 敏感的 localStorage hydration。

剩下两处确实值得改的:

**useDeepLinkHireFlow**: agentId 变 reset state 的 effect 改成 render-phase
setState (PR 3 同款 latch 模式),guard \`state.targetAgentId !== null\` 防循环。

**useFreeStatus**: 
- \`refresh\` useCallback inline 进唯一的 effect
- \`isFreeUser\` useMemo 删掉(返回 boolean,primitive 天然 referentially
stable,no identity worth memoizing)
- \`isFreeExpired\` / \`freeDaysLeft\` 的 useMemo 删掉 — 这两个**反而是
bug**:\`Date.now()\` 是隐式输入,useMemo 没法 track,导致 memo 在 \`[isFreeUser,
info]\` 上,countdown 直到下一次 auth/credits 事件触发前都冻住。inline 才正确。

## Why 系列只到 5 个 PR(原计划过 5)
原审计高估了反模式数量,深读后:
- PR 4 三个 B 类候选全是 prop/事件驱动,合不进 handler
- PR 5 六个候选只一个真有效;其他要么 SSR 风险(useState initializer + localStorage),要么
unmount-only cleanup 是 canonical 写法,要么是 navigate 自动化没事件 handler 可挪
- "scaling-down" 比硬上重要 — \`feedback_review_followup_verify_first\` 的精神

## Stats
2 files / +23 / -32 / 1 effect 删除 + 1 useCallback 删除 + 3 useMemo 删除 +
顺带修一个 stale-time bug

## Test plan
- [x] \`pnpm lint\` 绿
- [x] \`npx tsc --noEmit\` 绿
- [x] 相关单测全过(30/30: useDeepLinkHireFlow + useFreeStatus)
- [ ] CI 全绿
- [ ] staging:deep-link 流换 agentId 不卡;free 用户 countdown 显示

## Series 收尾
全 5 PR 系列 (#1396 / #1414 / #1421 / #1425 / 本):
- 真正消除的反模式 effect:11(ref-sync × 5,state-reset effect → key prop ×
2,latch effect × 2,disconnect ref reset 后续维持 effect,render-phase reset ×
1)
- 顺带:1 useCallback,3 useMemo,1 stale-time bug

refactor(web): lift effect-driven latch and reset to render-time (#1421)

## Summary
\`feature/use-less-effect\` 系列第 3 PR。把两类 React 官方文档明确推荐"渲染期做"的 effect
改成渲染期表达。

- **useDeepLinkHireFlow**: \`canUseChat\` / \`isChatReady\` 两个 ever-true
latch 从 \`useEffect(() => { if (x) setX(true) }, [x])\` 改成 \`if (x &&
!xEver) setXEver(true)\`(渲染期 setState)。React 官方"Storing information from
previous
renders"(https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#storing-information-from-previous-renders)就是给这种单调
latch 设计的。
- **useSubagentChat**: \`useEffect(() => { if (ws.status !==
'connected') { reset refs }}, [ws.status])\` 是纯 idempotent ref 写,直接挪到渲染期
\`if\` 块。session-scoped reset 上一 PR 已经迁到 \`key={sessionKey}\` 父级重挂。

## Why
- **Latch**: 渲染期 setState 在 React 调度里被认为是 "current render
的一部分",不会触发额外一次组件树渲染。effect 版本要等 commit 才 setState 再触发新一轮 render。改写后单调
latch 跟收到新值的那一帧同步生效。
- **Ref reset**: ref 写不参与 React 调度;放 effect 里只是多一层 closure deps,语义没区别。
- 不再追"effect → useMemo"机械式改写——\`useAgentSettings\` / \`useClawSettings\`
的 \`useEffect(() => loadSettings(), [loadSettings])\` 表面像派生状态、实际是"deps
变就 reload data",这是 useEffect 本职、也是 RQ 迁移 v2 的范围,不在本 PR 处理。

## Stats
2 files / +14 / -14 (净 0,主要是注释扩写) / 2 effect 删除 + 1 effect 改渲染期

## Test plan
- [x] \`pnpm lint\` 绿
- [x] \`npx tsc --noEmit\` 绿
- [x] 相关单测全过(61/61)——特别是 \`useDeepLinkHireFlow.unit.spec.ts:202\` 的
latch oscillation 回归测试不动通过,直接验证 render-time setState 保留单调性
- [ ] CI 全绿
- [ ] staging 复跑:deep-link 流(login → catalog 加载 → bot init →
redirect)、subagent chat 断线重连

<h2>plugin-react@5.2.0</h2>
<h3>Add Vite 8 to peerDependencies range <a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/1143">#1143</a></h3>
<p>This plugin is compatible with Vite 8.</p>

<h3>Fix <code>canSkipBabel</code> not accounting for <code>babel.overrides</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/1098">#1098</a>)</h3>
<p>When configuring <code>babel.overrides</code> without top-level plugins or presets, Babel was incorrectly skipped. The <code>canSkipBabel</code> function now checks for <code>overrides.length</code> to ensure override configurations are processed.</p>

<h2>plugin-react@5.1.1</h2>
<h3>Update code to support newer <code>rolldown-vite</code> (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/976">#976</a>)</h3>
<p><code>rolldown-vite</code> will remove <code>optimizeDeps.rollupOptions</code> in favor of <code>optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions</code> soon. This plugin now uses <code>optimizeDeps.rolldownOptions</code> to support newer <code>rolldown-vite</code>. Please update <code>rolldown-vite</code> to the latest version if you are using an older version.</p>
<h2>plugin-react@5.1.0</h2>
<h3>Add <code>@vitejs/plugin-react/preamble</code> virtual module for SSR HMR (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/890">#890</a>)</h3>
<p>SSR applications can now initialize HMR runtime by importing <code>@vitejs/plugin-react/preamble</code> at the top of their client entry instead of manually calling <code>transformIndexHtml</code>. This simplifies SSR setup for applications that don't use the <code>transformIndexHtml</code> API.</p>
<h3>Fix raw Rolldown support for Rolldown 1.0.0-beta.44+ (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/930">#930</a>)</h3>
<p>Rolldown 1.0.0-beta.44+ removed the top-level <code>jsx</code> option in favor of <code>transform.jsx</code>. This plugin now uses the <code>transform.jsx</code> option to support Rolldown 1.0.0-beta.44+.</p>
<h2>plugin-react@5.0.4</h2>
<h3>Perf: use native refresh wrapper plugin in rolldown-vite (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/881">#881</a>)</h3>

<h3>HMR did not work for components imported with queries with rolldown-vite (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/872">#872</a>)</h3>
<h3>Perf: simplify refresh wrapper generation (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/835">#835</a>)</h3>

<p><code>optimizeDeps.rollupOptions.jsx</code> is going to be deprecated in favor of <code>optimizeDeps.rollupOptions.transform.jsx</code>.</p>

fix: Treat AI Search bindings as always-remote in local dev</p>
<p>AI Search namespace (<code>ai_search_namespaces</code>) and instance
(<code>ai_search</code>) bindings are always-remote (they have no local
simulation), but <code>pickRemoteBindings()</code> did not include them
in its always-remote type list. This caused the remote proxy session to
exclude these bindings when <code>remote: true</code> was not explicitly
set in the config, resulting in broken AI Search bindings during
<code>wrangler dev</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>removeRemoteConfigFieldFromBindings()</code> in
the deploy config-diff logic was not stripping the <code>remote</code>
field from AI Search bindings, which could cause false config diffs
during deployment.</p>

<p>AI Search namespace (<code>ai_search_namespaces</code>) and instance (<code>ai_search</code>) bindings are always-remote (they have no local simulation), but <code>pickRemoteBindings()</code> did not include them in its always-remote type list. This caused the remote proxy session to exclude these bindings when <code>remote: true</code> was not explicitly set in the config, resulting in broken AI Search bindings during <code>wrangler dev</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>removeRemoteConfigFieldFromBindings()</code> in the deploy config-diff logic was not stripping the <code>remote</code> field from AI Search bindings, which could cause false config diffs during deployment.</p>

### Full Commit Message

chore(deps): ignore eslint-config-next major bumps in /web (#1420)

## Summary
- 给 \`eslint-config-next\` 加 major-bump ignore；关闭 #1417 (15.5.15 →
16.2.3)

## Why
\`eslint-config-next\` 跟 Next.js 主版本绑定（16.x ↔ Next 16）。我们在
dependabot.yml 已经 ignore Next major（停在 15.x），但 eslint-config-next
是单独的包，没被 ignore 联动。如果接受 16 而 next 仍是 15，lint 规则与 runtime 行为会 drift。

## Test plan
- [x] dependabot.yml 仅追加 ignore 块
- [ ] CI 绿后 merge → dependabot 自动 close #1417

feat(admin): customer events viewer (ECA-579) (#1451)

## Summary

Adds an "事件" button in the admin Users table that opens a modal listing
a user's recent LLM-usage events from bg / Lago, with a 4-chip range
preset (24h default / 7d / 30d / 自定义) and pagination. Three-tier
passthrough following the existing OrderHistoryModal pattern.

- **bg/Lago key correction**: `customer_id` in bg's URL is actually the
user's `team_id` (LAGO_API_CHARGE_BY=team_id), not the uid — the route
resolves `uid → team_id` via `user_repo.get_user(uid)` before calling
bg, mirroring `routes/credits.py:65`.
- **`per_page=50`**, default range is rolling 24h. Custom mode uses two
`<input type="date">` interpreted as UTC start-of-day / end-of-day.
- **No raw-JSON drawer** — table columns: Time / Code / Model / Prompt /
Completion / Total / Cost.
- **`billing_events.py` is a separate module** (not a method on
`BillingGatewayClient`) because that file is exactly at the 500-line cap
on main; the new module reuses the client's HTTP timeout + connect-retry
helper.

## Test plan

- [x] Backend unit tests: `pytest tests/unit/test_billing_events.py
tests/unit/test_admin_events.py tests/unit/test_admin_route_wiring.py
tests/unit/test_billing_client.py` (74 passing)
- [x] Frontend unit tests: `vitest run tests/unit/app/admin/` (62
passing) + middleware tests (63 passing)
- [x] `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint --max-warnings=0` clean on touched
files
- [x] Live `curl` against staging bg confirmed the response shape used
in the design (Time/Model/Tokens/Cost columns)
- [ ] Manual verification post-deploy: log in as admin, search a user
with recent activity, click "事件", verify all 4 range chips return data,
verify pagination Prev/Next bounds
